ATM Machine Simulation in Java
This project is a simple console-based ATM machine simulation written in Java. It includes the basic functionalities of an ATM machine such as:

Account balance inquiry
Cash withdrawal
Cash deposit
PIN change
Transaction history with humanized comments
Features
Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.
Withdraw Money: Allows the user to withdraw money, with balance checks to prevent overdraft.
Deposit Money: Allows the user to deposit money into the account.
Change PIN: Enables the user to change their account PIN after verifying the current PIN.
Transaction History: Logs and displays the history of transactions for reference.
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Compile the Java file using a Java compiler.
Run the compiled program in a console.
Usage
Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to enter their PIN. If the PIN is correct, they can choose from the available options to perform various operations. Each operation will be logged in the transaction history.

This project demonstrates basic Java programming concepts including control structures, methods, and user input handling.
